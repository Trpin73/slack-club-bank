# Slack Club Bank

Sure, [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank)'s cool, but why should you have to open a web browser when you spend all your time on Slack anyway? With Slack Club Bank, you can view finances on Transparency Mode-enabled organizations right from Slack.

Powered by the [Hack Club Bank API](https://bank.hackclub.com/docs/api).
